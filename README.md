## Data Sources & Methodology

**This project uses mock but realistic data** modeled on California festival economics and community surveys. No real PII included.

### Data Foundations

**Happiness Index (0–100):**
- **Baseline**: Ventura's 2022 Community Survey (resident satisfaction, quality of life)
- **Event boosts**: +10 to +16 points during festivals, based on CA studies showing 12–18% mood uplift
- **Example**: April Owl Festival = +11 points → 87 total

**Economic Impact:**
- **Spending**: $50–$100 per attendee (tickets, food, parking)
- **Visitor mix**: ~60% local, 40% out-of-town (Visit California data)
- **IMPLAN multiplier**: 1.5x for indirect impact
  - Direct spend: $100 → Total boost: $150 (includes vendor supplies, worker wages)

**Attendance:**
- 500–2,200 attendees (typical for small CA community events)
- Based on Olivas Adobe reports and similar venues

### Key Sources
- **Coachella benchmark**: $700M+ annual impact, 250K attendees
- **Small CA festivals**: $50K–$150K impact, 30–50% visitors
- UC Berkeley Business Review (2025) - "Rhythms of Growth"
- University of Minnesota Extension (2023) - Festival economic impact methods
- Visit California tourism data (2023–2025)

**IMPLAN modeling** shows how $1 spent locally creates $1.50 total impact through supply chain and wage spending—standard for city economic analysis.
